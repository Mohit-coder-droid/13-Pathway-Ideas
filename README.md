# 13-Pathway-Ideas

## Domain Selection :-
I selected my domain as Cricket, the chat model wtih the helps of agents will be able to get information about matches, get latest news, try doing some analytics on its own (like comparing between the players), will be able to book and cancel tickets.

The reason behind this domain selection is that cricket is a field in which we can have vast variety of data (both streaming and static)  to be integrated with Pathway pipeline, and can build up various agents for tackling different tasks. 

## Swarm using Gemini Model :-
I made a demo version of my multi-agent system. But it has some missing features: Like context_variables, no stream chat, and I don't why model get stuck in loop of calling the same agent again and again.
